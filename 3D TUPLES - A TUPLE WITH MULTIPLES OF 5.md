## JOINING TWO TUPLES

### AIM  
To write a Python program to join two tuples and display the result.

### ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.  
2. Define a function `join_tuples()`.  
3. Inside the function, create two tuples: `tuple1` and `tuple2`.  
4. Join the two tuples into a new tuple using the `+` operator.  
5. Print the resulting joined tuple.  
6. Call the function.  
7. End the program.
8. 
### PROGRAM

```
def join_tuples():
    tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)
    tuple2 = ('python', 'program')
    
    joined_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
    print(joined_tuple)

join_tuples()
```

### RESULT
Thus, the Python program successfully joins two tuples and displays the combined result.
